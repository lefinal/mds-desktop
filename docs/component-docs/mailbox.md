# MailBox

The *MailBox* component is located at `packages/renderer/src/components/MailBox.vue`.
This component provides two different views so that these two views and the functionality of switching between them can be
simply imported into a view to use it. The two views implemented in this component are the mailbox table with a paginated
list of intel and a view for displaying the intels or messages. Passed attributes, which are not props, to this component
are added to the surrounding .mailbox-container div.
